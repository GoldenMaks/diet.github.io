                    The first stages of this diet will likely result in significant weight loss due to the few carbohydrates allowed on the plan. But when you go back to eating normally after reaching your goal weight, you may gain some of this weight back.<br>
                    Research shows high-protein diets are effective for weight loss, but experts still do not know what the long-term effects are for your health and weight. And there is no evidence that having one all-protein day, along with exercise, is enough to maintain your weight loss.<br>

            <div class="phase" id = "final">

                    Unlike other high-protein diets, this plan focuses on lean protein sources over those high in saturated fat. And protein can make you feel fuller longer, helping you lose weight.<br>
                    The downside is that this plan doesn't teach lifelong healthy eating habits. Even more problematic, it recommends that you stay in the consolidation phase until you reach your goal. If you have a lot of weight to lose, this phase could go on for months or even years, which could lead to a nutritionally inadequate diet.<br>
                    If you’re looking to lose a relatively small amount of weight fast, then this diet may work for you. If you are over 50 or have a condition, like diabetes, or need to lose a lot of weight, talk to your doctor first.<br>
